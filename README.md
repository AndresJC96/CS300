# CS300 Reflection
Andres Cepeda

  In these projects, the main goal was to build an advising tool that could load, sort, and search through course information. Project One helped me break the problem down by comparing different data structures and understanding how each one handles run time and memory. Looking at vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees showed me why the choice of data structure matters. After comparing them, the binary search tree made the most sense because it keeps everything in order by default and makes searching easier.

  When I moved into Project Two, the planning I did earlier made the coding part much smoother. I focused on keeping the program organized and readable so I could understand it later without any trouble. I also made sure to separate the tasks into different functions and add comments wherever something needed an explanation. I ran into a few issues with loading the file and making sure the user input was handled correctly, but working through each part step by step helped me stay on track.

  Overall, this project helped me improve the way I design and write programs. I pay more attention to structure, naming, and readability, and I try to think about how someone else might use or update the code in the future. These projects also helped me understand data structures on a deeper level and made me more confident in choosing the right one for the job. It was a good experience that strengthened how I approach building software.
